        text: "Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.",

        text: "Democracy is not just freedom to criticize the government or head of state, or to hold parliamentary elections. True democracy obtains only when the people—women, men, young people, children—have the ability to change the system of industrial capitalism that has oppressed them since the earliest days of slavery: a system based on class division, patriarchy, and military might, a hierarchical system that subjugates people merely because they are born poor, or female, or dark-skinned.",

        text: "The governments of the world have failed us. Justice is dead. Our leaders and their coteries have made it their mission to protect their kin from the very laws they designed to keep our society safe. Criminals run free through our cities as their victims are being punished for daring to ask for justice.\n\nThe dark tendrils of corruption have dug too deep. It is our conviction that the system has been irrevocably broken by the criminals that have risen to power through deceit, theft and violence. We believe it is high time our oppressors have a taste of their own medicine.\n\nOur mission is thus: The severance of those tendrils from our society by any means necessary. We believe the current justice system to be too lenient on those who have, guided by greed and pride, inflicted great suffering on the people. The only way to purge the tumor of corruption is to take severe action against those that think themselves safe from justice.\n\nYou may hide in your multi-million dollar mansions, run away from us in your sports cars, but soon enough the darkness you’ve left behind will find you.\n\nThis is your first and only warning.\nWe are the darkness. We are the blacklisters.\n\nIustitia in tenebris.",
